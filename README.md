# SwiftSearch
CS50 Final Project


This web application utilizes a SQL database and the Spotify API in order to create a seach engine of (eventually) all of Taylor Swift's songs.

After the user logs in using their Spotify username and password, they  will be able to search this database by theme.

If the theme is present in songs by Taylor Swift, the web application will then create a Spotify playlsit which includes all of the songs that have that theme.
