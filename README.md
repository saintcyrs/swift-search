SwiftSearch is an online search engine which allows you to compile "playlists" of Taylor Swift's songs organized by theme.  

To use SwiftSearch is a relatively simple.

Configure your IDE with the CS50 library, Flask Session, and Python. Then run the script by typing flask run into the terminal. SwiftSearch should then be able to be used on a local port. Select as many themes from the list as desired, and then press "Go!" in order to see a list of songs by Taylor Swift that match those theme keywords.
